<p>It has taken me one month to learn Web front-end stuff.</p>
<p>turns out that learning front-end is just not enough.</p>
<p>I have to understand most of the details about how Web application works,what language it uses to describe pages,to definite behaviors,
and what framework it chooses to interact with a server.</p>
<p>I am no whiner, but this process really takes me a lot of time.</p>
<p>If you want to master the front-end, you have to know a bit about the back-end.</p>
<p>I will work hard as I can, hope all these efforts pays me back.
